# PokeStops and Gyms for Kingston ON (YGK)
This respository contains a JSON file of the PokeStops and Gyms in the Kingston, Ontario area, to be used to set up your own IITC Map (using various tools as described [here](https://gitlab.com/AlfonsoML/pogo-s2/-/wikis/How-to-add-new-PoI-to-your-city)). By importing this JSON file, it saves you from having to mark individual portals as PokeStops or Gyms. The resulting map can be very useful in helping you to plan your wayspot nominations in Wayfarer.

**Note: this file only contains PokeStop and Gym information for the Kingston, Ontario area.** It has been crowd sourced from the [YGK Pogo Community](https://ygkpogo.ca).

## How to Use This JSON File
It is assumed that you have installed both IITC and the PoGO S2 Plug-in ([instructions here](https://gitlab.com/AlfonsoML/pogo-s2/#install)) and your map looks something like this:

*If you have not set up your own map and don't know where to start, take a look at the [Wiki page](https://github.com/typographynerd/ygk-iitc-map/wiki).*

### To mark portals as PokeStops and Gyms
Click on **Pogo Actions**

*If you have previously imported a JSON file and want to update your map with a newer one, it is best to click on **Reset PoGo portals** first to clear out all the old markers and then import the updated file.*

After importing the file, your map will look something like this:
